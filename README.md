**Stock Market Data Pipeline using Kafka and AWS**

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an End-to-End Data Engineering pipeline for real-time stock market data. The pipeline uses various technologies such as Python, Apache Kafka, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Glue, Athena, and SQL to ingest, process, store, and analyze real-time stock market data.

The pipeline collects real-time stock data from multiple sources, processes it using Kafka, and stores it in AWS services (S3, Athena, Glue). The goal is to build a robust data pipeline that allows for quick ingestion and processing of stock market data for future analysis.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Amazon Web Services (AWS): For cloud-based storage and services.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): To store real-time stock market data in raw format.
Athena: To run SQL queries on the stored stock market data for quick analysis.
Glue Crawler & Glue Catalog: For automatic data cataloging and schema discovery.
EC2: For running the application server.
Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform for real-time data ingestion and processing.

**Dataset Used**
The dataset for this project is real-time stock market data. The data can be collected from various public APIs or external datasets, depending on the data source. The focus of this project is on building a data pipeline that handles the ingestion, processing, and storage of the stock data.

**Architecture Overview**
The architecture of the data pipeline is as follows:

**Stock Data Collection:**
Real-time stock market data is fetched from an external API.
The data is processed and formatted using Python.
**Data Ingestion with Kafka:**
The real-time data is ingested into Apache Kafka, which serves as a message broker for streaming data.
The Kafka producer sends stock data messages to Kafka topics.
**Data Storage with AWS S3:**
The Kafka consumer consumes the data from Kafka topics and stores it in S3 in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
**Data Cataloging with AWS Glue:**
Glue Crawler is used to automatically crawl the data stored in S3 and create a Glue Catalog that contains metadata about the stock market data.
**Data Analysis with AWS Athena:**
AWS Athena is used to query the stored stock market data using SQL for real-time analysis and insights.
